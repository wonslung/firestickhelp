You do not need to set up an Amazon account to use kodi, however if you wish to use Amazon Prime Video, Netflix or any other offical App, you must use an amazon account. (see Registering my Fire Stick to my Amazon Account)\n\nWhy am I being asked to rent or buy a video?\nAmazon sells this device as a viewing device for Amazon Video. Much of Amazon Video requires an Amazon Prime Membership.  You are probably looking for Kodi. If you have an Amazon Prime account or a netflix account (see Registering my Fire Stick to my Amazon Account)\n\n What the hell is a wonslung\nwonslung is my internet handle.  You better recognize.\n\nIs there a way to get more hd sources?\nThere is a pay service called Real-Debrid that gives you access to far more high quality HD links.  It's pretty low cost when you purchase 3-6 months at a time.  (documentation yet to be complete)\n\n Is there a way to create a list of favorite shows/movies?\nYes.  See Trakt TV (documentation yet to be completed)\n\nWhat is this message asking me if i want to update my build? (What is wonslung Wizard)\nGenerally speaking, when everything is working the way it's supposed to, you shouldn't NEED to update.  However, sometimes addons change, other times they stop working.  I periodically cut a new build to fix these issues and add new features (or remove broken addons).  Due to this, i built in a build wizard, (wonslung Wizard).  (documentation yet to be completed)\n",

With 3rd party addons, it can play almost any type of video file and stream media from all over the internet. (3rd party addons are not affliated or supported by the kodi development team)\n\n{{ warning title=\"First Start\" }}\nWhen you first start Kodi please allow 60-90 seconds before attempting use.\n{{ /warning }}\n How to navigate Kodi\n{{ note title =\"Note\" }}\nThese instructions are specific to the wonslung FireStick Skin kodi build\n{{ /note }}\nWhen you open Kodi you will see the following menu:\n\nThe Fire Stick remote navigation button is used to navigate the main menu menu. Most menu items have a drop down menu that is activated by pushing down.\n\n{{ note title =\"Note\" }}\nThe menu items will generally stay the same in the wonslung FireStick Skin build but I may occasionally add or remove sections. I try to focus on working apps as opposed to stuffing the build with useless content\n{{ /note }}\nMain Menu drop down menus\nMost main menu sections have a drop down menu. (*to activate the dropdown menu push the down arrow*)\n\n Kodi Menu widgets\nMany menu items have live widgets. For example, the TV Shows section has a widget that displays the current most popular TV Shows.\n{{ note title =\"Note\" }}\nThese widgets generally take a couple minutes to load when you first start kodi\n{{ /note }}\nTo make use of widget, simply use the remote to navigate up, and then left or right to select the item you want, as shown in the images below.\n\nOverview of Main Menu items (as of v1.5)\nSearch Search for movies and tv shows\nAddons Addons for Kodi\nMovies Find and watch movies\nTV Shows Find and watch tv shows\nLive TV Live tv channels and feeds\nSports Sporting events and pay per view\nKids Cartoons and children programs\nComedy Comedy movies and standup\nExtra All in one apps\n10.
